            <p>View Source is a conference for front-end web developers. The goal
              of this event is to provide an in-depth, practical look at current
              and on-the-horizon technologies, with plenty of opportunities for
              conversation.</p>

            <p>At View Source, we share best practices for improving how websites
              are built across platforms and devices, with technical talks exposing
              these best practices with practical development techniques. By
              exploring what is and is not working on the web of today, we can
              view the source of the modern web and pave the way for the web of
              tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Our first event, View Source 2015, was held in Portland, Oregon,
              November 2nd through the 4th at the Gerding Theater at the Armory.
              More than 400 front-end developers, designers and industry leaders
              came together to discuss the web of today and explore the possibilities
              of the web of tomorrow. You can revisit the sessions from View Source
              2015 (or discover it for the first time) below.</p>

                  <p>In an ideal scenario, when you’re going to convert a non-responsive
                    site into a responsive one, you start from scratch and do everything
                    right and perfectly from the beginning. But in reality, starting from
                    scratch is simply not practical or possible for many (or even most)
                    projects. So what can we do to overcome some of the most common obstacles
                    and still get to that elusive, mobile-first, responsive site? In this
                    talk, I’ll go behind the scenes through the nitty-gritty of a real
                    world responsive retrofitting project, and provide useful tips that
                    can be put in practice by other teams facing similar challenges.</p>

                  <p>React has popularized the notion of deferred rendering via
                    a “Virtual DOM” despite the concept being universally ridiculed
                    shortly after React’s announcement. Deferred rendering is not
                    a new concept, it wasn’t born out of Facebook - it is an extension
                    of established practices tailored to the web. Sometimes it’s
                    useful to take a step (or 20) to the side, solve a new problem,
                    and see how it affects your perspective when you return to
                    daily life. In this session we’ll learn how to build a particle
                    system from scratch, render it to HTML5 canvas, and then circle
                    around and link the concepts back to modern web application
                    development.</p>

                    we will introduce what's possible in SVG, what tools we have

                  <p>Think of the humble pie chart. Simple and ubiquitous, yet
                    surprisingly difficult to create with Web technologies in a
                    flexible, maintainable way. Faced with this simple goal, Lea

                    aspects of CSS and SVG and will sweep you off your feet with
                    clever ways to use them. At the end, you will have your pie
                    and animate it too, but do not be fooled: the real takeaway
                    of this talk has little to do with pie charts and a lot to do
                    with problem solving via the tools the Open Web Platform

                    <p>Allen Wirfs-Brock was the project editor of the ECMAScript
                      2015 Language Specification, the international standard

                  <p>The web has many unique and amazing attributes - low friction,
                    reach, discoverability - but it has also suffered from poor
                    reliability, low engagement, and in general a bad user
                    experience of “apps” built on the web. This doesn’t need to
                    be. With new capabilities like Service worker and push
                    notification, and careful design of your web applications,
                    killer web experiences are possible. It’s a new world. Let’s
                    take a look at how it fits together.</p>

                  <p>The Web of 2020 will be a very different Web. People who
                    predict the future are often spectacularly wrong so I’m not
                    going to try and do that. I do, however, want to identify
                    a number key ideas that I think are fundamentally shaping
