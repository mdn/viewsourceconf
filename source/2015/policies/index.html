        <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

        <h2 id="purpose">1. Purpose</h2>
        <p>A primary goal of Mozilla's View Source is to be inclusive to the
          largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse
          backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly,
          safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual
          orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion
          (or lack thereof).</p>

        <p>This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who
          participate in our conference community, as well as the consequences
          for unacceptable behavior.</p>

        <p>We invite all those who participate in View Source to help us create
          safe and positive experiences for everyone.</p>

        <h2 id="open-sourceculturetech-participation">2. Encouraging and Recognizing Participation</h2>

        <p>A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase meaningful
          collaboration by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen
          the relationships between our actions and their effects on our conference
          community.</p>

        <p>Intentional, positive action is essential to avoid replicating within
          our conference community the many forms of inequality that exist in
          greater society. For this reason, we outline in this Code of Conduct
          expected behavior as well as prohibited behavior.</p>

        <p>If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our conference
          community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to
          contribute to the fullest extent, recognize them for their good work
          either personally or by letting conference organizers know.</p>

        <h2 id="expected-behavior">3. Expected Behavior</h2>

        <p>The following behaviors are expected and requested of all conference
          community members:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you
            contribute to the health and longevity of this conference community.</li>
          <li>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.</li>
          <li>Attempt collaboration before conflict.</li>
          <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and
            speech.</li>
          <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
            Alert conference community organizers if you notice a dangerous
            situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct,
            even if they seem inconsequential.</li>
          <li>Remember that conference community event venues may be shared with
            members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these
            locations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="unacceptable-behavior">4. Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

        <p>The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable
          within our conference community:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Violence and threats of violence.</li>
          <li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging
            a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li>
          <li>Derogatory comments related to gender, gender identity and expression,
            sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality,
            physical appearance, body size, race, religion, or socio-economic
            status.</li>
          <li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where
            they're not appropriate.</li>
          <li>Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying
            information (“doxing”).</li>
          <li>Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names.</li>
          <li>Inappropriate photography or recording.</li>
          <li>Physical contact or simulated physical contact (e.g. textual messages
            like "hug" or "backrub") without affirmative consent.</li>
          <li>Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or
            jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.</li>
          <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).</li>

            and presentations.</li>

        <h2 id="consequences-of-unacceptable-behavior">5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

        <p>Unacceptable behavior from any conference community member, including
          sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.</p>

        <p>Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.</p>

        <p>If a conference community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the
          conference organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to
          and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the conference
          community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).</p>

        <h2 id="reporting-guidelines">6. Reporting Guidelines</h2>

        <p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any
          other concerns, please notify the conference conduct team as soon as
          possible by emailing viewsource-conduct@mozilla.com.</p>

        <p>Additionally, conference organizers are available to help conference
          community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise
          help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context
          of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired
          by the person experiencing distress.</p>

        <h2 id="addressing-grievances">7. Addressing Grievances</h2>

        <p>If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating
          this Code of Conduct, you should notify the conference conduct team
          (viewsource-conduct@mozilla.com) with a concise description of your
          grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our
          existing governing policies.</p>

        <h2 id="scope">8. Scope</h2>

        <p>We expect all conference community participants (contributors, paid
          or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of
          Conduct in all conference community venues – online and in-person –
          as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to conference
          community business.</p>

        <p>This Code of Conduct and its related procedures also applies to
          unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of conference
          community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely
          affect the safety and well-being of conference community members.</p>
