            <p>Our speakers are awesome, but there’s more to View Source—it’s equal parts sharing, learning, and meeting new people. Discuss and collaborate in an on-going hacking space, chill in comfy hangout spots, see some great demos, and participate in engaging discussions. Evening activities will provide a fun, friendly space to continue the conversation and start new ones.</p>
